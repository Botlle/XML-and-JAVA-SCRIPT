created html table for each feild and attribute of the xml file and included java script file path location in html file.

Dynamically loaded data  from xml into the  html table .

In the JS file i have got all the elements and attributes which were in the XML file with their specific tag names.

I have accessed the nodes in XML file using getElementsByTagName() method.

And returned those retrived values from XML to the html table columns.

If there is no table found a message is displayed to the user that "Table element is not found."


Attached the output images in outputscreenshots.md file
